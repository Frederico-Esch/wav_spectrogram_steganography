# Doing some research on how to hide files

## Inspirations & fonts
- [hackster](https://www.hackster.io/sam1902/encode-image-in-sound-with-python-f46a3f)
- [fileformat](https://docs.fileformat.com/audio/wav/)
- [soundfile sapp](http://soundfile.sapp.org/doc/WaveFormat/)

## Future & purpose
Even tho I liked, and got most of the code from [hackster](https://www.hackster.io/sam1902/encode-image-in-sound-with-python-f46a3f) I definitely can improve it, and get it much more pythonic, for now I'm using this just a simplified version of their code, but eventually my plan is to actually do the improvements.
